      <h3>Polices </h3>
      <p>
        The following policies will be followed by both client and tech to ensure the best experience as possible. 
        1. Deposits: A $50 deposit will be required to secure your appointment. This deposit will be applied to your total bill. All deposits and final payment are non refundable. 
        2. Cancellation / Rebooking: I require at least 48 hours notice if needing to cancel your appointment, if you no show are more than 15 minutes late, or cancel within 24 hours of your appointment your deposit will not be applied to a rebook appointment. If cancellations occur more than 48 hours in advance you have 24 hours to reschedule in order to transfer deposit to new appointment. Cancelation fee must be paid within 12 hours or all future appointments will be cancelled. 
        3. Tardiness: Please arrive at your scheduled time at least 5-10 minutes early and wait in the waiting area. I allow a 15 minute grace period if I am notified, anything longer than 15 minutes will result in a limited service, or a cancellation and loss of deposit. 
        4. Nail Health: I do not work over other artists work and will not work on damaged nails. My goal is to build up your natural nail and to maintain a healthy nail plate, but in order for me to do my job, your nail health is my top priority even if that means waiting. If you have nails on from a previous salon please add a forgien removal to your appointment.
        5. No guests: I would prefer if guests and/or children were left at home. If you are being dropped off I will notify you 20-30 minutes before the service is done so you can contact your ride.
        6. Final Payment: Final payment can be made via cash or venmo. If being made by venmo, must be sent with confirmation before leaving.
        7. New sets are required every 4th appointment. 1st set- full set, will fill nails 2 times so 4th set will be a new set again ie: removal + forms for length.
