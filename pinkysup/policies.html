                <h2> Foreign Work</h2>
                <p> I do not work over other artists work and will not work on damaged nails. My goal is to build up your natural nail and to maintain a healthy nail plate, but in order for me to do my job, your nail health is my top priority even if that means waiting. If you have nails on from a previous salon please add a foreign removal to your appointment.</p>

                <p>I would prefer if guests and/or children were left at home. If you are being dropped off I will notify you 20-30 minutes before the service is done so you can contact your ride.</p>
